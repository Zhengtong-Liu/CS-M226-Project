# CS-M226-Project

This is the repo documenting the project Non-linear Genetic Effects for Complex Traits.

Group Members: Yu-Wei Chen, Zhengtong Liu, Jacob Wallin.

Main work:
* Study Variational Inference for the Polygenetic Risk Scores models (Bayesian Networks, Spike and Slab Priors, Evidence Lower Bound, etc.);
* Modify the Biologically Annotated Neural Networks (BANNs) architecture to capture non-linear genetic effects within genes;
* Compare BANNs with Variational Inference of Polygenic Risk Scores;
* Apply Polygenetic Risk Scores models to genotype data from 1000 Genomes Project and simulated phenotype (experience with PLINK).
